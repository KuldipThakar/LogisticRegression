# LogisticRegression
Solving Logistic Regression Problems for Single-Class and Multi-Class Classification with Generated and Imbalanced Data


Generating synthetic data for both single-class and multi-class classification.
Handling imbalanced data by using appropriate techniques (e.g., class weighting, sampling).
Solving these problems using Logistic Regression.

Data Generation: Use make_classification or other methods to create synthetic datasets for both binary (single class) and multi-class classification problems.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Address class imbalance by either oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or adjusting class weights in Logistic Regression.

Logistic Regression: Apply Logistic Regression with the generated data for both single-class and multi-class classification.

Model Evaluation: Use accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for performance evaluation.
